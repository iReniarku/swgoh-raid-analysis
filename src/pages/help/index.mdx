# 🛸 SWGoH Raid Analysis - Help Guide

<Card title="Getting Started" icon="🚀">
  Welcome to the SWGoH Raid Analysis tool! This application automatically analyzes your guild's raid performance based on CSV files from Wookiebot.

  ## Quick Setup

  ### 1. Fork This Repository
  1. Go to [https://github.com/bataillon-swgoh/swgoh-raid-analysis](https://github.com/bataillon-swgoh/swgoh-raid-analysis)
  2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top right to create your own copy of the repository
  3. Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-guild-raids`, `guild-name-analysis`)
  4. Make sure it's set to **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
  5. Click **"Create fork"**

  #### Keeping Your Fork Up to Date
  To get new features and bugfixes, you should regularly update your fork from the original repository:

  1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
  2. Click the **"Sync fork"** button (usually above the file list or in the "Contribute" dropdown)
  3. In the dialog, click the **"Update branch"** button to sync your fork with the latest changes from the original repository.

  **Warning:** Never click **"Discard Commits"** when syncing your fork! This will permanently delete your own raid results and data. Always use the **"Update branch"** option to keep your changes.

  ### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
  1. Go to your new repository on GitHub
  2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
  3. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
  4. **Important:** After forking, GitHub Actions workflows are disabled by default. Go to the **Actions** tab and click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"** to activate the workflows for your fork.
  5. The workflow will be automatically detected

  ### 3. Add Your Guild Data
  1. In Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, use the Wookiebot command:
     ```
     /raid guild
     ```
     Add your desired parameters (effort level, etc.)
  2. Download the generated CSV file from Wookiebot

  ### 4. Upload Your Data
  1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the `/data` folder
  2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
  3. Upload your downloaded CSV file(s)
  4. Commit the changes with a message like "Add raid data"

  ### 5. Automatic Deployment
  - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site
  - Your analysis will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/`
  - The build process takes 2-3 minutes

  ### 6. Adding More Data
  - Repeat steps 3-4 whenever you want to add new raid data
  - The site automatically updates with each new CSV file upload
