# 🛸 SWGoH Raid Analysis - Help Guide

<Card title="Getting Started" icon="🚀">
  Welcome to the SWGoH Raid Analysis tool! This application automatically analyzes your guild's raid performance based on CSV files from Wookiebot.

  ## Quick Setup

  ### 1. Use This Template
  1. Click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repository
  2. Choose **"Create a new repository"**
  3. Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-guild-raids`, `guild-name-analysis`)
  4. Make sure it's set to **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
  5. Click **"Create repository from template"**

  ### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
  1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
  2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
  3. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
  4. The workflow will be automatically detected

  ### 3. Clean Up Sample Data
  1. In your forked repository, navigate to the `/data` folder
  2. Delete all existing CSV files (these are sample data)
  3. The folder should be empty after this step

  ### 4. Generate Your Guild Data
  1. In Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, use the Wookiebot command:
     ```
     /raid guild
     ```
     Add your desired parameters (effort level, etc.)
  2. Download the generated CSV file from Wookiebot

  ### 5. Upload Your Data
  1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the `/data` folder
  2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
  3. Upload your downloaded CSV file(s)
  4. Commit the changes with a message like "Add raid data"

  ### 6. Automatic Deployment
  - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site
  - Your analysis will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME/`
  - The build process takes 2-3 minutes

  ### 7. Adding More Data
  - Repeat steps 4-5 whenever you want to add new raid data
  - The site automatically updates with each new CSV file upload

  ### 8. Updating Your Fork (Getting New Features)
  When the original repository gets updates with new features or bug fixes:

  1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
  2. Click the **"Sync fork"** button (if available) or:
  3. **Manual sync via GitHub web interface**:
     - Click **"Compare"** → switch the comparison to see updates from original
     - Create a pull request from the original repository to your fork
     - Merge the pull request to get the updates
  4. **Alternative - Delete and re-fork**:
     - If you haven't made custom changes, simply delete your fork
     - Fork the repository again to get the latest version
     - Re-upload your CSV data
