#### Keeping Your Fork Up to Date
To get new features and bugfixes, you should regularly update your fork from the original repository:

**Recommended:**
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub


2. Click the **"Sync fork"** button (usually above the file list or in the "Contribute" dropdown)
3. In the dialog, click the **"Update branch"** button to sync your fork with the latest changes from the original repository.

**Warning:** Never click **"Discard Commits"** when syncing your fork! This will permanently delete your own raid results and data. Always use the **"Update branch"** option to keep your changes.



### 2. Enable GitHub Pages & Actions
1. Go to your new repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. **Important:** After forking, GitHub Actions workflows are disabled by default. Go to the **Actions** tab and click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"** to activate the workflows for your fork.
5. The workflow will be automatically detected

### 3. Add Your Guild Data
1. In Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, use the Wookiebot command:
   ```
   /raid guild
   ```
   Add your desired parameters (effort level, etc.)
2. Download the generated CSV file from Wookiebot

### 4. Upload Your Data
1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the `/data` folder
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. Upload your downloaded CSV file(s)
4. Commit the changes with a message like "Add raid data"

### 5. Automatic Deployment

- The build process takes 2-3 minutes

### 6. Adding More Data

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings
- Verify that GitHub Actions completed successfully (check the "Actions" tab)
- Wait 2-3 minutes after upload for the build to complete

### No Data Showing
- Ensure CSV files are uploaded to the `/data` folder (not the root)
- Check that CSV files follow the Wookiebot format
- Verify that the CSV files contain actual data (not empty)

### Build Failures
- Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for error details
- Ensure CSV files are valid and not corrupted
- Try re-uploading the CSV files
